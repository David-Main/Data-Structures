# Data structures

Data needs to be structures in order to be properly and easily accessed.  
Take a look at The Enlish Dictionary,  

We see that it is easy to use because they have an organized  
structure.
The Dictionary for example is sorted alphabetically, hence, its ease of use.

**_In computing;_**  
Data structures ar a way to store and organize data in a computer so that
it can be used efficiently

## Abstraction ðŸ“ºðŸ“º

A television doesn't present itself to you as a logic board with a screen,  
rather, just a screen and a remote for user friendliness.  
In the same way, there are data types that do not reveal their mode of operation,  
yet they work as advertised. These data types are known as Abstract Data Types [ADTs];

ADTs can define how data is stored data and operations performed on them  
without defining their implementation. Examples of ADTs are:

1. Arrays
2. Linked lists
3. Stacks
4. Queues
5. Trees
6. Graphs

Some of the concepts analysed under ADTs are:

- Logical view
- Operations
- Cost of operations
- Implementation
