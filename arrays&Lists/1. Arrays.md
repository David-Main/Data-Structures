# Arrays

## Summary

#### Arrays Properties:

1. Has a fixed size.
1. Provides random access to elements via indexing.
1. Stores elements in a sequential block of memory.
1. Elements are all of the same type.
1. Arrays are zero indexed in C++ and some other languages.

#### Operations On arrays and their complexities

1. Indexing > : O(1) - constant time.
2. Traversal : O(n) - linear.
3. Insertion : O(1) - constant time.
4. Modifying an element : O(1) - constant time
5. Deleting an element : O(1) - constant time
6. Counting Number of elements : O(1) - constant time

## Details

Say we want a data structure that:

1. Stores a give n number of elements
2. Can write/modify elements at any given location
3. Can read an element at a position

An array would come to mind because this is very easy to implement  
using arrays.

But if we wanted to have a more dynamic data structure, we may want  
the structure to:

1. Have an empty list/set at the start.
2. Insert at any position
3. Remove at any position
4. Count number of items.
5. Read/modify an element at any position.
6. Specify a data-type for its members
7. Grow as needed.

Properties 2, 3 and 7 are cases where cost of operations can be increased drastically.  
For 2 and 3, it would demand that items are to be copied.

#### Example:

Let A be an array, containing elements of some data type.

## A :

<img src=images/array.svg width=250 >

    int A[DEFAULT_SIZE]		// A is created with a fixed default size;
    int end = -1; 		// keep count of elements (count = end + 1);

- For any insert operation eg, at index 2,  
  elements 3 and 4 would have to be shifted to the next position  
  on their right i.e. element 3 would become element 4 and element 4  
  would become element 5 and so on.  
  This would cost time, a lot of time, should the count be very large  
  and insert position is closer to index 0.

- The same can be said for property 3, removing an element at any position.

- For property 7, if DEFAULT_SIZE is reached, a new array of a bigger  
  size, preferrably twice the current size has to be created and all  
  elements in the old Array would be copied to the new array.  
  Again, since A has become very large, it would cost time and memory  
  to perform such an operation.

## Conclusion

Arrays are great yet you have ot consider what the use case is  
and weigh its performance in that use case against other data structures  
in order to make a good choice.
