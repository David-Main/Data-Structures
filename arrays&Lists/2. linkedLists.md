# Linked lists

Instead of using an array in which operations at a point in time  
may use too much memory, a linked list will rather create elements by  
requesting and initializing memory as and when needed.

### Properties of Linked lists:

1. Each element/ node has two parts;  
   one part to store the data and another part to store the memory address  
   of the next element.
2. The first node is known as the head node
3. The address of the head gives access to the entire list
4. Acess to elements is linear and uni-directional.  
   i.e. access to element g will require that we first access the  
   head and look for the next element until g is found or obtained.
5. It is easy to insert and remove elements without shifting.
6. At any point, memory requested for is used hence, there is no free memory.

### Operations on linked lists:

1. Indexing : O(n) - linear time.
2. Traversal : O(1) - constant time.
3. Insertion : O(n) - linear time.
4. Modifying an element : O(n) - linear time
5. Deleting an element : O(n) - linear time
6. Counting Number of elements : O(n) - linear time

## Caveats

- Accessig an element costs time.
- Inserting an element also cost time  
  This is because if an element is to be inserted at position x,  
  we could first need to travers the list all the way to x position before  
  performing the insert.
- Just like insertion, deletion is also time costly[O(n)] for the same reason.

## Pros

- all memory acquired is used and there is no unused memory.
