# Doubly linked Lists

This type of list Data structure is similar to a singly linked list  
except that for each node, it has an additional pointer variable for  
storing the address of the previous in a list.

The advantage of this is that it allows for easier manipulation of data  
as well as implementation of operations.  
The one downside to this is that extra memory is used for the storage  
of the additional pointer variable.

### Properties of Linked lists:

1. Each element/ node has three parts;  
   one part to store the data, another part to store the memory address  
   of the next element, and the last part to store the memory address  
   of the previous element.
2. The first node is known as the **_head node_**
3. The last node is called the **_tailnode_**
4. The address of the head gives access to the entire list
5. The address of next stored in the tail node is a null pointer  
6. The address of the previous node stored in the head node is a null pointer.
7. Acess to elements is bi-directional.  

### Operations on linked lists:

1. Traversal : O(n) - linear time.
2. Insertion : O(n) - linear time.
3. Modifying an element : O(n) - linear time
4. Deleting an element : O(n) - linear time
5. Counting Number of elements : O(n) - linear time
